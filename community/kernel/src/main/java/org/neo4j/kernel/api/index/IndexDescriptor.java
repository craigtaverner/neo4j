/**
 * This is a new version of the old IndexDescriptor interface created here only to allow
 * older versions of Cypher to run on newer kernels. This is because Cypher supports older
 * cypher-compiler modules to be instantiated and run within newer versions of Neo4j, and they
 * assume certain kernel API's remain unchanged. However, the IndexDescriptor was refactored
 * considerably during the 3.2 development process to allow for composite indexes and constraints.
 * We should remove this class as soon as older Cypher compilers are re-released without any
 * kernel dependency on this.
